Dimaka! VSCode Extensions!

Some extensions of mine:

- [GitHub Manager](https://github.com/zardoy/github-manager) to quickly switch between cloned repos via `owner/name` search
- [Better Snippets](https://github.com/zardoy/vscode-better-snippets)
- [npm Rapid Ready](https://github.com/zardoy/npm-the-fastest)
- [Extra Commands](https://github.com/zardoy/extra-commands) contains commands that should be builtin

... and even more
