Dimaka! VSCode Extensions!

Some extensions of mine:

- [Better Snippets](https://github.com/zardoy/vscode-better-snippets)
- [npm Rapid Ready](https://github.com/zardoy/npm-the-fastest)
- [Extra Commands](https://github.com/zardoy/extra-commands) contains commands that should be builtin
- [Vetur Extended](https://github.com/zardoy/vetur-extended) (for Vetur/Volar) simple code completion, go to reference from template
- [Extended Extensions](https://github.com/zardoy/vscode-patches) - experimental extensions that give new possibilites!
